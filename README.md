# Project Title

Just some examples of the 6-Minute interview, currently only JAVA. This is just an example of how we run this.  To get better insights and an idea how it plays please contact me.  

The only purpose for this coding exercise is to help screen candidates better for their fit on an Extreme Programming (XP) team.  Specifically, if the interviewer would want to invest significant time (money) for their company AND the interviewee candidate to come in and do a more extensive face-to-face interview.  Prior to the 6-minute screen I have candidatesâ€™ self-rate themselves on skills needed for the position they are applying for (e.g. JAVA, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, "cloud", TDD, Collaborative Programming, XP, Agile...etc).  *yes, I am well aware of the Dunning-Kruger effect.

The format of the actual screen is a video chat with screen sharing on computers, not phone.  I always start with describing the screen; how I'll ask some questions, perform the 6-minute screen, then they can ask me questions.  I follow that with 2-4 questions total about a range of things from their resume, development mindset and their self-ratings.  I then share out my screen and grant the interviewee control of my mouse and keyboard and read the instructions.  When my timer goes off I stop the screen share.  Sometimes, very rarely, I have 1-2 questions about what they did in the exercise.  Most of the time open it up to questions they might have about "the position, company or the exercise".  The screen in this form normally takes 15-30 minutes.

### Installing

As this is just folders and different code files, select the appropriate langugage files and install them into an empty template TDD project.

## Running the tests

Run the tests as appropriate with your language of choice.
