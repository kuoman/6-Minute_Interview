This is a preliminary screening...

1. You will have 6 minutes for this exercise.

2. You are not expected to finish this test, no one has.  This is about seeing how you approach and solve the challenge.

3. You can use anything you'd normally use during this exercise (e.g. google, ask questions, the IDE...etc)

4. The purpose is that we know your thoughts and what you are thinking.  So, the more you talk us through what you are
doing and thinking, the better.

5. You are allowed and expected to only work within the two open files.

6. Please feel free to ask questions to me/us.  We may or may not be able to answer them and will answer accordingly.

All tests are failing, please make them pass.  I will start the timer as soon as you click on one of the two files.
